by Natalie Dunbar | User Experience Design

If you had a way to engage users of your products and services, particularly (and especially) before they launch, and you could observe those users could as they interact with a live or prototype version of whatever you’re building, what would it be worth to you?

If you could engage with those users – we prefer to call them participants – in a lab-like setting as close to a real usage scenario as you can create in a corporate space, have them use and poke at your product and then give you on-the spot-feedback on whether or not they would use what you’ve built and how exactly they would use it, how quickly would you jump in line for a chance like that?

YP is fortunate enough to have space in our offices dedicated to just that purpose: the Usability Lab. As you can imagine, in a building where the demand for conference room is high compared with a somewhat limited supply, the lab is a space coveted by many. Yet, because it is in use on a near-weekly basis, testing everything from consumer-facing features on YP.com and YPmobile, to products and services built for our Advertisers, it is a space that is exclusively dedicated by necessity.

### Usa-what?

The International Standards Organization (ISO) defines Usability, in part, as “…the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context.”
  
That’s a fancy way of saying “If you build it, can they use it? And if they can (are “able to”) will it be used as intended?” 

In garnering that kind of hands-on feedback, stakeholders from across the organization (engineering, product, marketing, etc.) get a first hand look at how our products are solving user problems – or, even more important, how a product actually may create a problem. The best part about the latter scenario is that if you’ve recruited your participants correctly, they will usually articulate how to improve on the pain points they identify, often without prompting.

### Recruiting Participants

Before ever setting foot in the lab, our Usability Specialists are usually contacted by a Product Manager who is either building a new product or feature, or improving on an existing one. After a kick-off meeting and a first look at the product, either as a prototype, in a QA environment, or live in production (and sometimes as wireframes or comps), the Usability Specialist works with the product stakeholder to create the basis for a testing script. 

This “test” is really a set of tasks that you want the participants to complete – and we are quick to tell each participant that there are no right or wrong answers to this “test.” We want their pure, honest and completely unfiltered feedback. We’re not worried about getting our feelings hurt in the process because we want to help our stakeholders build a better – and usable – product.

### Testing, Testing

The real fun begins when you’re actually sitting in the lab, observing participants as they walk through each task. The Usability Specialists’ main job is to listen and to guide – not lead – the participant through a series of tasks to see if they can achieve the end goal that the product was created to achieve. You also want to note how long it takes, and how satisfied (or not) the participants are with what is being tested.

We’re also lucky enough to have an Observation Room where stakeholders can sit opposite a one-way mirror (with the participants knowledge and permission) and watch and listen to what the participants have to say. 

There is nothing like getting a first-hand look at how what you’ve built will be used in near-real world scenarios. It can be a bit painful and maybe even a bit harsh sometimes, but because the participants are representative of the people you’ve built your product or service for, there is no better way to eliminate pain points and solve problems before you launch.
