div Hey, I'm Jordan Santell, a JavaScript engineer in Philadelphia all up in web audio, node apps, build tools and designing beautiful APIs. Creator of <a href="http://github.com/jsantell/dancer.js" title="dancer.js">dancer.js</a>, <a href="http://github.com/jsantell/poet" title="poet">poet</a> and <a href="http://github.com/jsantell/ogg.js" title="ogg.js">ogg.js</a>, I'm currently consulting, slamming down Backbone and node applications. Scope out my <a href="/projects" title="Projects">open source projects</a>, where each line of js is like a love note, carefully crafted and sealed with a kiss.
