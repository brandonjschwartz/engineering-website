Outfit of the day by Sara!

YP fashion police spotted Sara with an awesome spiky t-shirt.  
She got it at a secret store called [Foreign Exchange Clothing Store](http://www.shopfe.net/eshop/pages.php?pageid=37) so don't tell anybody it exist.  
They also have a [real store](http://www.yellowpages.com/glendale-ca/mip/foreign-exchange-464661235) not far from our Glendale office.
