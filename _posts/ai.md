The day may come when computers successfully pass any Turing test and become our equals (or our betters) in cognitive ability, but until then we still have access to the power of millions of human brains thinking in parallel. Microtask crowdsourcing breaks a daunting project into small, simple tasks, distributes them to a “crowd” of anonymous internet dwellers, and aggregates the results. Through [Amazon Mechanical Turk](www.mturk.com), and other crowdsourcing platforms YP has quietly but steadily developed experience and expertise with a variety of use cases since 2006. 
Hours of Operation Standardization – A simple formatting task that would serve as training data for YP’s state of the art parsing algorithms.
Business URL Validation and Closed Business Validation – Data validation is still labor intensive, and we have used a combination of in house experts and crowdsourced labor with mixed success.
Category Relevancy and Search Query Categorization – Generating training data for Primary Category Designation and Search algorithms.
Category Keyword Associations – Search Engine Marketing to drive relevant traffic.
Photo Moderation - Curating user generated content at 1/6 market price!
Search Relevancy – Stacking the YP Search Algorithm up against its biggest competition to expose the weaknesses and strengths of each.
Spellchecking – Identify the edge cases when a small business owner thinks it’s cute to misspell their store “Starz” instead of “Stars.”
Query/Geo segmentation – Training data for a Single Search Box initiative.
This concept has the potential to change the way we work tomorrow. IBM has (to some measure of public outcry) leaked the pilot for a radical staffing program called [Liquid](http://knowledge.asb.unsw.edu.au/article.cfm?articleid=1677). Only a small circle of executives will remain in the German offices, and all other staff will work in a freelance capacity. 
The initial reaction might be one of outrage at another way of reducing working standards for the middle class in the name of cost savings, but a different (and perhaps more enlightened) view could see this as a step towards a utopia of worker freedom. If tech companies expand their use of crowdsourcing the way IBM is starting to, workers gain the power to set their own hours and sell their skills in a dynamic marketplace. An ambitious project manager or software developer may work on projects for several different companies at the same time, while someone with a seasonal hobby could take months of the year off and still be confident that work will be available when they return. Any remaining prejudices are wiped out, and people will be hired solely on the basis of their qualifications.
Are these the ramblings of an objectivist lunatic? A coming golden age made possible by the internet? Do you see any more benefits or drawbacks? Let’s hear what you think in the comments.
