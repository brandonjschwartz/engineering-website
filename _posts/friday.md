How do I know when it's Friday?  When I get looks like this...

Normally during the week, I tend to dress business casual; nothing outlandish or enough to stand out.  The rest of the office doesn't subscribe to my more conservative dress.  The flip-flops, shorts, and bow tie crowd can be pressuring, but I have to have my slacks and dress shirts!  
  
However, it's not just the casual dress you might notice being different...

When my hair is six inches straight up, you know it's finally FRIDAY!
