We are All in Sales
=========
 
In 1949 Arthur Miller wrote in [Death of a Salesman]:

> The only thing you got in this world is what you can sell. And the funny thing is, you're a salesman, and you don't know that.

You might be an engineer or in operations, but you are also in sales.
 
This is what [Daniel Pink], New York Times bestselling author, asserts in his new book [To Sell is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others].

The jacket cover claims the book will:
> ...change how you see the world and transform what you do at work, at school, and at home.

That's a pretty bold claim, and I'll reserve judgment till I've finished it. But, so far its a good read and very applicable to our mission at YP - helping businesses and communities grow.

Too busy to read it? 

If you only have time for "cliffnotes", Pink was interviewed by a member of our editorial team - they are responsible for the great content we see on the YP home page.

Do you agree? Why / why not?
