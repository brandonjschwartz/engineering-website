(Same exact guy)

Over a fifteen-month period, I lost 139 pounds of fat and put on 13 pounds of lean muscle.  Hold your applause.  I did it _all wrong_.  I could've done it in ten months, but I'm lazy.  Some of the advice I'm going to give you, I periodically would ignore, myself.  I think you should stick to it, though.  This approach should really appeal to engineers and _especially_ testers, as we're metrics-driven people who enjoy combining tiny atomic behaviors to produce a significant result.

Here's a brief overview of what I did.

## Motivation
I'm a video gamer from way back.  I've always been a little fascinated with the high-jumping back-flipping pole-swinging heroes of that digital world.  I made a conscious decision that I wanted to do some of that stuff myself before I was too old or damaged for it to be a possiblity.  Enter [parkour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour).  It's perfect for me, since I'm non-competitive and prone to bursts of enthusiastic jumping-on-stuff anyway.

## Ingredients
1x [The Four Hour Body](http://fourhourbody.com/), by Tim Ferriss
1x 45 lb. kettlebell
2x pair running shoes

### Micro Book Review
The Four Hour Body was written by the dude who wrote The Four Hour Workweek.  I'm a big [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com) fan, and they're big Tim Ferriss fans.  Some of the stuff in that book is crazy.  Some of it works.  In some cases, both are true.  I've tried a lot of it, but some of it I wouldn't try with YOUR body.

## The Slow-Carb Diet (The First 90%)

### Five simple rules:
1. Avoid "white" carbohydrates.
2. Eat the same few meals over and over again.
3. Don’t drink calories.
4. Don’t eat fruit.
5. Take one day off per week.

Eat four meals daily, spaced about once every four hours.  Drink more water than you think you need.  Get 8 hours of sleep per night.

There's a lot of science behind these little rules.  If you care, read the book or read the Internet.  I cared.  I did a whole heckuva lotta reading.  It probably helped to motivate me.  The big difference between slow-carb and the more common-sense caloric restriction diets is that slow-carb will not cannibalize an ounce of muscle.  Another big difference is that taking a "cheat day" prevents the depletion of willpower that causes most diets to fail.  Cheesecake is great, and you still get cheesecake.  You just don't get it until your weekly cheat day.  Then you're encouraged to eat the whole dang cheesecake yourself.

### Examples
Here's a typical day's eating for me:

- Breakfast
  - 3 whole eggs, fried in macadamia oil
  - Black beans from the can
  - Baby spinach in olive oil with salt & pepper
  - Vitamins B & D, Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium supplements
- 1st Lunch, 2nd Lunch, Dinner
  - Tri-tip steak
  - Black beans from the can
  - Steamed brocolli, steamed cauliflower

If I had nothing ready to eat, these were my most common meals from fast-food places:

**Chipotle:** Fajita bowl with black beans, steak, fajita veggies (no rice), mild salsa, guacamole, lettuce
**El Pollo Loco:**  Family meal deal w/ 8 pcs. mixed, no tortillas, pinto beans, and steamed veggies

## Aww man, Exercise?! (The Last 10%)
1. Two-arm Russian Kettlebell Swings
2. Turkish get-ups
3. Pushups
4. Pullups
5. Myotatic crunches
6. Running

I'm no physical trainer.  I can't tell you whether you should actually *do* any of these.  I know that these are the exercises I did, and I did rotating circuits with progressively-increasing loads.

For what it's worth, I lost about 80 lbs. before I started exercising _at all_.

In my case, I had two concerns:
1. The bigger they are, the harder they fall
2. Losses + gains simply resemble weaker losses.

If you've got a lot of fat to lose, diet alone will get you a huge part of the way.

## Protips
1. There will be a plateau about 6-8 weeks into the diet.  It'll pass.  Just don't change anything.
2. Eat your first meal within an hour of waking and go protein-heavy with it.
3. Snap pictures of every meal (including cheat days) and upload them to Tumblr or Instagram or whatever.  Blah blah science accountability blah.  It works.
4. Take before and after photos.  When the "Before" ceases to embarrass you, you know you're making progress.
5. Weigh yourself and measure the circumferences of each upper arm, each thigh, your chest, waist, and hips _daily_.  Those inches will show you that, even on days you're not losing _weight_, you're still reshaping your body in a meaningful way.
6. Hold off on buying new clothes until you absolutely can't go out in your old stuff anymore.  People won't notice you're skinnier until you buy new clothes.

## Conclusion
- This is a thing that works.
- It's not the _only_ thing that works.
- It appealed to me because it was made of little hacks that, when taken together, produce a huge result.
- Food is made of science.
- Bodies are made of science.
- My blood pressure is normal for the first time in my life.
- I don't secretly dread being photographed anymore.
- PARKOUR!
