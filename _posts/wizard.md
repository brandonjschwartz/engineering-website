This weekend Node Knockout hackathon was happening.   
163 teams all over the world hack for 48 hours whatever they feel like.  
Here is one fun game created by Substack and Dominic -   
it's an online 2d adventure game where you can cast spells on any object around you by changing the object's javascript code!  
you can even turn your friend to a monster or a rock if they pisses you off!  
Click on anything around you to see it's code and start hacking!
