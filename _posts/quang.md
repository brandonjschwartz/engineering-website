I'm currently working as a software engineer on the search team.  My previous job was a qa engineering and a release engineer, which I managed testing and source code management.  I hope to apply the same experience and contribute at my current job.

Outside of work, I enjoy going to the gym and doing photography in my spare time.  I also post-process my own photos.  I'm not a picky person in general, but I am in my photography because I strive for perfection even though it doesn't exist :)

That's pretty much me in a nutshell.
