On May 9th, 2013 we celebrated our 1 year anniversary as an independent company. Some of us celebrated by attempting the art of [Hadouken](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/29/hadouken-meme_n_2979482.html) and [Vadering](http://technabob.com/blog/2013/04/11/vadering-is-the-new-planking/)! Goodie bags, food trucks, and some crazy employees, and then back to work helping businesses and communities grow!
