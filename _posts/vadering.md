On May 9th, 2013 we celebrated our 1 year anniversary as an independent company. 

Goodie bags, food trucks, fun and games, and some crazy employees who celebrated by attempting the art of [Hadouken](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/29/hadouken-meme_n_2979482.html) and [Vadering](http://technabob.com/blog/2013/04/11/vadering-is-the-new-planking/)! 

Then, back to work helping local businesses and communities grow.
