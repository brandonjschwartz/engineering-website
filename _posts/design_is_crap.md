# Design is CRAP 
## - Design principles for programmers
### by Chris Lemcke

# Why you need to know it.


But I'm a programmer, you say, not a designer!  Nope, tough cookies, design is part of the job.  

###Let me tell you a story.

I work at YP on the internal tools team.  We often have data requirements for new tools, but we never have design documents.  This means we have to build our own projects from scratch, and they never see design love from anyone but us.  This means that, for the first time for me, I've been really responsible for the look and feel of my projects.  Yikes!  Like many developers, I'm used to receiving a psd, or at minimum a wireframe before even starting on a project.  So I had to learn to design for the first time.

Scary, right?  However,

###A programmer, you are the first line of defense.
It's your responsibility as a programmer to make anything you touch as good as possible.  Every new feature, every tweak, and every bug you fix affects the user experience.  So why not make it as good as possible?

It's not too hard, really, just follow these four basic principles.

# Remember - Design is CRAP!
## - Contrast
## - Repetition
## - Alignment
## - Proximity

#Proximity
###Related elements should be grouped together
Group elements that are meaningfully related.  Don't be afraid to use a lot of space to separate different groups!

Let's see an example of terrible design:

### Wow, that's bad!  Let's clean up the spacing using Proximity

### Now, isn't that better already?
It doesn't take much to make a big difference!  Let's move on...

# Alignment
### Every item should have a visual connection to related items on the page.  
Make a visual grid that connects every element to something related on the page.  In the same way as **Repetition**, use visual distinctions to indicate meaningful differences.

See how we use indents to separate headers from content?  Also note the use of a horizontal rule to give a visual anchor for the prices.

# Repetition
### Repeat some aspect of the design throughout the entire piece

Repeat some aspect of the design throughout the entire piece.  Repeat some aspect of the design throughout the entire piece.  Repeat some...okay you get it, this one's pretty straightforward.

### Coming along nicely!

# Contrast

### Emphasize the difference between different items

This is basically the flip side of **Repetition**.  Use emphatically different styles for different types of information.  Don't be afraid to use small fonts, with proper use of spacing, alignment, and repetition, small fonts can be easy to read.  

Let's see what we can do with our example:

Here we use a fancy title font, we get rid of the awful all-caps, and we resize the less-important side text.

#Let's Review

## Contrast
* Emphasize the difference between different items.

## Repetition
* Repeat some aspect of the design throughout the entire piece.

## Alignment
* Every item should have a visual connection to related items on the page.


## Proximity
* Related elements should be grouped together.

# Remember, Design is CRAP
### But have fun with it!

# What's next?  Steal!

Look at the web and see what you like, and then use a css/html inspection tool like chrome or firebug and steal it!  **Don't** use frameworks, pre-rendered classes, or libraries.  Do it yourself, one line at a time.  That's the best way to learn.
