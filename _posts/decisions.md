*The 4 Villains of Decision Making*

----------

Still deciding what idea to invest your time in Hackathon?  
Have a big decision coming up?
 
[Here] is great new resource from Chip Heath and Dan Heath (the Heath Brothers), that may help - "[Decisive: How to Make Better Choices in Life and Work]". 

Note: I used [Dillinger] to generate the markdown for this post. No pun intended given the subtitle.

### Introducing the Villains

![Some other villains...](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65968/2666246-Marvel-Villains-by-Dr-Warez-marvel-comics-30563363-2560-1485.jpg)

According to the brothers, the 4 villains of decision making are: 
 
1. **The Spotlight Effect** - forming decisions too early with too little information, or having *too narrow* a frame of reference.   
 
2. **Confirmation Bias** - the tendency we have to make decisions based on the limited information in #1, and then look for information that confirms our decision rather than gathering new and possibly contrary information. 
 
3. **Getting Caught Up in Short Term Emotion** - getting distracted by our gut reactions which are likely based on limited information and understanding and not having done our due diligence failing to look well into a matter.

 Indulge a slight rabbit trail here: I used the phrase "look well" into a matter" to summarize this villain. Its an interesting word. In this context (an adverb) "well" means to look into something "in a good and proper manner", "with skill or aptitude",  and "with careful close attention" (source: [Webster]). Without doing extensive historical linguistic analysis, I suspect there is some correlation to the noun form of "well" meaning essentially a spring or source of water / gas / oil etc. Wells are usually deep. 
 
 So avoiding getting caught up in short term emotion requires a long, hard, deep look into the matter.
 
 On to the next villain... 
 
4. **Overconfidence** - based on the faulty assumptions gained from the 3 villains above, we are too confident in the outcome of our decisions and the validity of our predictions of the future.
 
### Defeating the Villains

How do we avoid these villains? Someone once said, "Failing to plan is planning to fail", so in that spirit the brothers also provide a strategy for combatting them: 
 
1. **Widen your Options** 
Seek to expand your choices to a set rather than limiting yourself to a narrow yes/no decision. 
 
2. **Reality Test your Assumptions** 
Even with a few choices you need to avoid your tendency toward confirmation bias and get out of your own head and objectively look at trustworthy information.  (Teaser alert: the book includes 2 key skills to learn in this regard: turning around a contentious meeting in 30secs, and how to spot expert advice you should avoid). 
 
3. **Attain Distance Before Deciding** 
Avoid letting short term emotion drive your choice. Many of us can relate to the shiny new car buying experience in the dealership, though thankfully this can be avoided due to the plethora of information out there and the impact of the Internet on car buying. Don't impulse - decide. In the book, learn the simple question that makes agonizing decisions simple. 
 
4. Live with your decision, but **Prepare to be Wrong** 
Give your decisions the best chance to succeed in the long run by planning how to react to the aspects you'll find you got wrong. Prepare to be wrong. Prepare for the unexpected. 
 
Hopefully this will provide some fodder for thinking about your Hackathon efforts, and as it was for me, some fine-tuning your own decision making process in work and life.
