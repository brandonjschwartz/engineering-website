On April 10th, 5 members of the YP Ad Delivery team  - David Shin, Andy Wong, Kim Tran, Asim Memon, and Nadia Adhami â€“ visited the California Science Museum in downtown.
They were eager to see the Space Shuttle Endeavour, placed at its permanent home where a new addition, [Samuel Oschin Air and Space Center](http://www.californiasciencecenter.org/GenInfo/Membership/Campaign/Campaign.php), was built to house the space shuttle.   

Endeavour - known as the Orbiter Vehicle-105, completed 25 missions into space, including the first service mission to the Hubble Space Telescope and the first mission as a U.S.-built component to the International Space Station. The YP team also saw a SSME - the most advanced, efficient rocket engine in the world, which helped push the shuttle up to orbit.
