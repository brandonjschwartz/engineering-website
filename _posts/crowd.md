Imagine an industry buzzword that described millions of human brains thinking in parallel

Microtask crowdsourcing breaks a daunting project into small, simple tasks and distributes them to a "crowd" of anonymous internet citizens. Using [Amazon Mechanical Turk](www.mturk.com), and other crowdsourcing platforms YP employees have quietly but steadily developed experience and expertise with a variety of use cases since 2006.  

**Hours of Operation Standardization** - A simple formatting task that would serve as training data for parsing algorithms.  

**Business URL Validation and Closed Business Validation** - Data validation is still labor intensive, and we have used a combination of in house experts and crowdsourced labor with mixed success.  

**Category Relevancy and Search Query Categorization** - Generating training data for Primary Category Designation and Search algorithms.  

**Category Keyword Associations** - Search Engine Marketing to drive relevant traffic.

**Photo Moderation** - Curating user generated content at 1/6 market price!  

**Search Relevancy** - Stacking the YP Search Algorithm up against its biggest competition to expose the weaknesses and strengths of each.  

**Spellchecking** - Identify the edge cases when a small business owner thinks it's cute to misspell their store 'Starz' instead of 'Stars.'

**Query/Geo segmentation** - Training data for a Single Search Box.  

As you can see, our most common use is measuring subtleties in datasets that computer algorithms are unable to detect. Microtasking means that the work is short, simple, and repetitive, but more complex forms of crowdsourcing are beginning to evolve and build their niche. Sites like [99designs](http://www.99designs.com) for logo designs, [uTest](utest.com) for QA, [TopCoder](http://www.topcoder.com/) for software development, and [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/) for data science are targeting a more qualified workforce and moving crowdsourcing into new territory.  

## Join the Crowd, Be Assimilated or Resist Futily

The crowd may be a model for the future white-collar workforce. IBM Germany has (to some measure of public outcry) leaked the pilot for a radical staffing program called [Liquid](http://knowledge.asb.unsw.edu.au/article.cfm?articleid=1677). Only a small circle of executives will remain in the German offices, and all other employees will work in a freelance capacity through a special crowdsourcing platform. 

The initial public reaction might be one of outrage at another attempt to erode the rights of the working class in the name of cost savings, but an optimistic (and perhaps more enlightened) view could interpret this as a step towards a utopia of worker empowerment. If tech companies expand their use of crowdsourcing the way IBM is starting to, workers gain the freedom to set their own hours and sell their skills in a dynamic marketplace. An ambitious project manager or software developer may work on projects for several different companies at the same time, while someone with a seasonal hobby could take months of the year off and still be confident that work will be available when they return. Remaining prejudices are wiped out, and people will be hired solely on the basis of their qualifications.  

Are these the ramblings of an objectivist lunatic? A future golden age made possible by the internet? Do you see any other benefits, drawbacks or opportunities? Let's hear your thoughts in the comments.
