* Prefer flossing before brushing.
* Floss from the top of the tooth down and don't re-use the same strip on the next tooth.
* Use toothpaste with ADA seal of approval only. No other feature matters.
* Brush after non-acidic food meals. Wait 30 mins. after eating something acidic or brush before.
* Brush in a circular motion up to the gumline. Be gentle. You're taking things off the surfaces.
* Don't rinse.
* If a flouride rinse, straight after brushing teeth. Otherwise, wait 30 mins.
* Use mouthwash apart from brushing times, too.
