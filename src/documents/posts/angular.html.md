Look at your recent javascript codebase and tell me the truth.  
isn't it a total and utter mess?  
I don't blame you. Javascript is a language of amatures -  script kiddies at the 90' copy pasted crappy code into their crappy websites and it somehow worked.  
the trend continued throw the new millenuim and up until 
now everyone ignore that toy language.
in the last few years Javascript raised to a new super power level. it's EVERYWHERE.

* declerative
* plain old js objects
* testable
* blaaoeuoe

```javascript
  function() {
    console.log('hi');
  };
```
